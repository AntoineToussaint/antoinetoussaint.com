I am building this website as a way to practice and learn (ok, play) with new technologies.

## General setup

This website is hosted in GKE, Google cloud managed Kubernetes. Already have experience with AWS and Azure managed Kubernetes -- this is my favorite.

## Home

This is a React SPA served with `nginx`.
